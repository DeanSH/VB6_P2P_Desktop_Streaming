# VB6_P2P_Desktop_Streaming
R4 Screen View was an experimental Desktop sharing application, allowing users to either Host there own Desktop stream with a password for connecting, or join and view someone else's Desktop by knowing their respective IP address, port and password! It only supports viewing, not desktop interaction. Picture quality is also adjustable.

# Notes
Screenshot provided, if get any error about missing files, run the VB6 all needed files + Reg provided,
which basically registers a bunch of commonly used dll's and ocx files for my various VB6 projects.

# How To Use
Simple run the R4 Screen View exe, put the port and password desired for hosting your desktop stream, tick host and start!
For viewing open the same exe, then user inputs the IP address, port and password and clicks start!
If fails to connect then likely it was not allowed in through the firewall, or router port forwarding is needed.
