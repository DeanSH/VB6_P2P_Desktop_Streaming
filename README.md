# VB6_P2P_Desktop_Streaming
R4 Screen View was an experimental Desktop sharing application, allowing users to either Host there own Desktop stream with a password for connecting, or join and view someone else's Desktop by knowing their respective IP address, port and password! It only supports viewing, not desktop interaction.
